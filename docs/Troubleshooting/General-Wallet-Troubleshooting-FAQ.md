# Wallet Syncing Issues

##### Why is my wallet not syncing? 

1. Make sure you are running the latest wallet version from [the Official Bulwark Github](https://github.com/bulwark-crypto/Bulwark/releases) and your wallet is closed.
2. Head over to the Bulwark folder (How to do that is explained below).
3. Delete all files except wallet.dat, bulwark.conf, masternode.conf and the backups folder.
4. Open your wallet

##### My wallet is taking a very long to sync, what can I do?

* You can attempt to sync using the officially supplied bootstrap, instructions for which can be found in [The Bootstrap Atricle](https://kb.bulwarkcrypto.com/Information/Bootstrap/)
* You can enable UPnP Port Mapping to help with possible networking issue
    1. Open the *Settings* tab
    2. Click the *Network* tab
    3. Click the checkbox that says "Map port using UPnP"
